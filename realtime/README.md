# Real-time-semantic-segmentation-of-videos-for-scene-analysis
Generally many deep learning architectures are not Real-Time,inference time is 2-3 seconds for standard sized frames on GPU. Here we propose an robust pipeline Real-Time analysis of road scenes using ENet architecture followed with a temporal tracking part.
